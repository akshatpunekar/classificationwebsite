# classificationwebsite
This is the code for a Django website where you can upload csv/xls files and then the website performs classification on it using the Scikit-learn library of Python. There is also a basic login/register function which makes use of the postgres database. Once the csv/xls file is uploaded, you can choose the predictor variables and the target variable accordingly. The website also gives you a detailed analysis of the dataset using the pandas-profiling library. You can also choose one of the predefined classification algorithms and the size of the test-train split in the website itself. The final page gives you the accuracy of classification and other parameters related to classification.
